Running applications in containers instead of virtual machines is gaining momentum in the IT world. The technology is considered to be one of the fastest growing in the recent history of the software industry. At its heart lies Docker, a platform that allows users to easily pack, distribute, and manage applications within containers. In other words, It is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.
Docker Statistics & Facts
 2/3 of companies that try using Docker, adopt it. Most companies who will adopt have already done so within 30 days of initial production usage, and almost all the remaining adopters convert within 60 days.
 Docker adoption is up 30% in the last year.
 Adopters multiply their containers by five. Docker adopters approximately quintuple the average number of running containers they have in production between their first and tenth month of usage.
 PHP, Ruby, Java, and Node are the main programming frameworks used in containers.
